# team milestones

- [ ] (i) follow track in reality from RL in simluation

# milestone (i)

- [ ] with variable texture / lights (contrast)
- [ ] remove center line
- [ ] train with variable width?
- [ ] add track with tight turn
- [ ] add ~200ms (or 1 step) delay between agent output and action
- [ ] try trainin smaller networks

# stan

- [x] try a 1 GPU instance eventually have multiple of them
- [x] try fixed std normal exploration
- [x] plot action/value/entropy loss min/max/mean/media reward
- [x] add telemetry image to human game to check how turns are seen
- [x] move to 3 laps
- [x] try capped speed reward
- [x] try discrete action space
- [x] try augmenting the stack frame
- [~] experiment with residual networks

- [ ] try orstein-hullenbeck exploration with normal logprobs
- [ ] try reshaping the reward to go negative instead of stopping on road exit

- [x] randomized track
- [ ] randomized physics

- [ ] multiple donkeys in simulation
