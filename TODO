- [x] experiment with brake (25 less distance because of random braking)
- [x] add time to help value computation (27 faster convergence)
- [x] remove the 2x for action_logstd (~35 seems positive)
- [x] increase angles window (~40)
- [x] test with recurrent generator (~35 seems slightly less stable)

- [x] test with recurrent NN
  - /keybase/team/dr1ve/experiments/exp_20180311_1205

- [x] separate policy
- [x] game ~= 1 run + stall time limit
- [x] web or pygame based control for human perf
- [x] second stage learning reward based on time only (time/speed rewards)
   - best lap time: 28.7
- [ ] multiple run on same machine
- [ ] multiple donkeys in simulation
