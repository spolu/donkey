- [x] experiment with brake (25 less distance because of random braking)
- [x] add time to help value computation (27 faster convergence)
- [x] remove the 2x for action_logstd (~35 seems positive)
- [x] increase angles window (~40)
- [ ] test with recurrent generator (~35 seems slightly less stable)
  - /keybase/team/dr1ve/experiments/exp_20180310_0851
- [ ] test with recurrent NN
- [ ] increase time limit

- [ ] separate policy
- [ ] web or pygame based control for human perf
